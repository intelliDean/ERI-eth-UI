The file has a few missing closing brackets. Here's the corrected version with the missing brackets added:

```jsx
// At line 1012, there was a missing closing bracket for the className prop
<button
  type="submit"
  disabled={myItems.length === 0}
  className="w-full bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-purple-700 text-white py-3 px-6 rounded-lg font-semibold hover:from-purple-700 hover:to-purple-800 transition-all duration-300 shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
>

// At line 1012, there was a duplicate className prop that needed to be removed

// At line 264, there was an unclosed h2 tag that needed to be removed
<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">
```

These were the main syntax issues in the file. After adding these corrections, the file should now be properly formatted and free of syntax errors.
