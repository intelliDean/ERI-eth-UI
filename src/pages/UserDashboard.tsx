The file has a few syntax errors related to missing closing brackets. Here's the corrected version with the missing brackets added:

1. Fixed duplicate `className` attribute by removing one instance:
```jsx
<button
  type="submit"
  disabled={myItems.length === 0}
  className="w-full bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-purple-700 text-white py-3 px-6 rounded-lg font-semibold hover:from-purple-700 hover:to-purple-800 transition-all duration-300 shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
>
```

2. Fixed unclosed `h2` tag by removing the duplicate:
```jsx
<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">
  User Dashboard
</h2>
```

3. Added missing closing bracket for the component:
```jsx
export default UserDashboard;
```

The file should now be properly formatted with all necessary closing brackets and tags.
